                <p> Web developers obviously need strong technical abilities. But when hiring a web developer,
                    candidatesâ€™
                    soft skills can be just as important as their tech prowess.

                    During a time when many IT professionals are working at home, abilities like communicating clearly
                    and
                    tactfully with colleagues within or outside of the department who are also remote can determine
                    whether
                    someone flourishes or flounders on the job.

                    To avoid the high costs of a bad hire, you may want to reexamine how you vet job candidates. Here
                    are 16
                    of the best web developer interview questions, the first 10 of which relate to soft skills. </p>
